# OneDrive Backup Tool

Breaking free from Microsoft is hard. MSFT does everything they can to lock you in. This Backup Tool is for OneDrive users with a lot of data on OneDrive, who want an easy way to download all that data at once but don't have space on their local machine to do so.  
  
This Python script will automatically backup your entire OneDrive (for personal accounts) to an external hard drive of your choice, and preserve your exact OneDrive folder structure.

## Features

✅ **Automatic authentication** via Microsoft Graph API  
✅ **Preserves folder structure** exactly as in OneDrive  
✅ **Auto-refreshing tokens** - can run for days/weeks without re-authentication  
✅ **Real-time progress tracking**  
✅ **Handles large backups** (500GB+)  
✅ **Supports documents and pictures** (configurable file types)  
✅ **Resume capability** - automatically continues from where it left off if interrupted  
🔒 This tool runs entirely on your local machine.  
   - No credentials are stored or transmitted to any third party  
   - No file content is uploaded to any server  
   - All data stays between your computer, Microsoft's servers, and your external drive  
   - Your Azure app credentials are only used for direct authentication with Microsoft  

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- External hard drive with sufficient space
- Microsoft personal account with OneDrive
- Azure app registration (free, one-time setup)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onedrive-backup.git
cd onedrive-backup
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Azure Setup (One-Time)

Before using the script, you need to create an Azure app registration:

### Step 1: Create App Registration

1. Go to [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
2. Sign in with your personal Microsoft account
3. Navigate to **App registrations** → **+ New registration**
4. Fill out the form:
   - **Name:** `OneDrive Backup Tool`
   - **Supported account types:** "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"
   - **Redirect URI:** Platform: `Web`, URI: `http://localhost:8080`
5. Click **Register**

### Step 2: Get Application (Client) ID

1. On the app's **Overview** page, copy the **Application (client) ID**
2. Save this - you'll need it when running the script

### Step 3: Create Client Secret

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets** (left sidebar)
2. Click **+ New client secret**
3. Description: `OneDrive Backup Secret`
4. Expiration: `24 months`
5. Click **Add**
6. **IMMEDIATELY copy the Value** (you can only see it once!)
7. You can copy the Secret ID if you want, but you won't need it for this process
8. Save this with your Client ID

### Step 4: Set API Permissions

1. Go to **API permissions** (left sidebar)
2. Click **+ Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph**
4. Select **Delegated permissions**
5. Search for and add these permissions:
   - `Files.Read.All`
   - `offline_access`
6. Click **Add permissions**
7. Click **Grant admin consent** and confirm

You should see green checkmarks next to all permissions.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python3 onedrive_backup.py
```

Follow the prompts:
1. Choose option **2** (Login to OneDrive online)
2. Choose option **1** (App Credentials)
3. Enter your **Application (client) ID**
4. Enter your **Client Secret**
5. Enter `common` for Tenant ID
6. Browser opens - sign in and approve permissions
7. Copy the redirect URL from browser and paste into terminal
8. Enter your external drive path (e.g., `/Volumes/MyDrive`)
9. Choose what to backup (documents, pictures, or both)
10. Let it run!

### What Gets Backed Up

By default, the script backs up:

**Documents:**
- PDF, Word (.docx, .doc), Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
- PowerPoint (.pptx, .ppt), Text files (.txt)
- CSV, RTF, ODT

**Pictures:**
- JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP
- TIFF, SVG, WebP, HEIC, RAW

You can modify these file types in the script if needed.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication:** Uses OAuth 2.0 with delegated permissions
2. **Token Management:** Automatically refreshes access tokens (valid for 90 days)
3. **API Calls:** Uses Microsoft Graph API to list and download files
4. **Structure Preservation:** Recreates exact OneDrive folder hierarchy on external drive
5. **Progress Tracking:** Shows real-time file counts and paths

## Output Structure

Your backup will be organized exactly as in OneDrive:

```
/Volumes/YourDrive/OneDrive_Backup_20241203_051234/
├── Work/
│   ├── Projects/
│   │   ├── Report.docx
│   │   └── Data.xlsx
│   └── Presentations/
├── Personal/
│   ├── Photos/
│   │   ├── 2023/
│   │   └── 2024/
│   └── Documents/
└── [your exact OneDrive structure]
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Token expired" error
The script automatically refreshes tokens. If this fails, you may need to re-authenticate (run the script again).

### "Destination drive not found"
Make sure your external drive is connected and mounted. Use the exact path shown in Finder.

### "Invalid client secret"
You copied the Secret ID instead of the Value. Go back to Azure and create a new client secret, then copy the **Value** column.

### Browser doesn't open
Make sure `webbrowser` module is available (it's built into Python). Try running in a different terminal.  

### Script was interrupted  
If the backup stops for any reason (power loss, crash, Ctrl+C), simply run the script again with the same settings. It will automatically resume from where it left off. Progress is saved every 10 files in a hidden `.progress.json` file in your backup folder.  
  
### Token keeps refreshing without downloading  
This can happen during initial folder scanning if you have many folders. The script will eventually stabilize and begin downloading. If it refreshes more than 6 times in a row, stop the script (Ctrl+C) and restart it.  

## Security Notes

- Your Client Secret should be kept private (don't commit to public repos)
- Access tokens expire after ~75 minutes
- Refresh tokens last 90 days and auto-renew when used
- The script never stores your Microsoft password
- All authentication uses official Microsoft OAuth flows

## Limitations

- Personal Microsoft accounts only (work/school accounts have different requirements)
- Requires interactive login once per session
- Download speed depends on your internet connection
- Large files may take time to download
