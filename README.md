## 🔧 Azure Setup

Both tools require Azure app registrations with different permissions. You'll need to create **two separate apps** (one for each tool):

### For OneDrive Backup
**Permissions needed:**
- `Files.Read.All` (Delegated)
- `offline_access` (Delegated)

### For OneNote Exporter  
**Permissions needed:**
- `Notes.Read` (Delegated)
- `Notes.Read.All` (Delegated)
- `offline_access` (Delegated)

**📖 Detailed setup instructions:**
- OneDrive: See `onedrive-backup/README.md`
- OneNote: See `onenote-exporter/QUICKSTART.md`

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

Both tools follow security best practices:

- ✅ **OAuth 2.0 authentication** - Industry standard
- ✅ **No passwords stored** - Only temporary tokens
- ✅ **Tokens expire automatically** - Access tokens last ~75 minutes
- ✅ **Tokens auto-refresh** - OneDrive v2.0 handles this automatically
- ✅ **Local data only** - Nothing sent to third parties
- ✅ **Open source** - Review the code yourself
- ✅ **Read-only access** - Scripts never modify your Microsoft data

### Data Flow
```
Your Microsoft Account 
    ↓ (OAuth authentication)
Microsoft Graph API
    ↓ (Secure download)
Your Computer (Local Storage)
    ↓ (Optional)
External Drive / Import to Other Apps
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Both Tools
1. **Test first** - Start with small backups/exports
2. **Stable internet** - Both need reliable connection
3. **Keep originals** - Don't delete Microsoft data for 30 days
4. **Check output** - Verify before deleting sources

### OneDrive v2.0 Specific
- ✅ Use online login for complete backup (includes cloud-only files)
- ✅ If files fail, press 'y' to retry immediately
- ✅ Check failed files report - categorized by type
- ✅ External drive needs space (check OneDrive size first)
- ✅ Can backup 40GB+ files (adaptive chunking)
- ✅ Resume works perfectly - stop/start anytime

### OneNote Specific
- Read MIGRATION_GUIDE.md to choose target app
- Export format depends on destination (Joplin vs Evernote)
- Audio/video files take longest to download

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Both Tools)

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify you copied the Secret VALUE (not ID) from Azure
- Check API permissions are granted (green checkmarks)
- Make sure Redirect URI is `http://localhost:8080`

**"Python not found"**
```bash
# Try python3 instead of python
python3 --version
```

**"Can't install requests"**
```bash
# Try with --break-system-packages flag (Python 3.11+)
pip install requests --break-system-packages

# Or use pip3
pip3 install requests
```

### OneDrive v2.0 Specific

**"Only got 200 files but I have more!"**
✅ **Fixed in v2.0!** Update to v2.0 to get all files.

**"HTTP 401 errors everywhere!"**
✅ **Fixed in v2.0!** Tokens now auto-refresh.

**"Huge files timing out!"**
✅ **Fixed in v2.0!** Now uses adaptive chunks (50MB for >10GB files).

**"Missing thousands of files!"**
✅ **Fixed in v2.0!** The pagination bug is resolved. Re-run backup to get all files.

**"10 files failed - what should I do?"**
✅ **v2.0 feature!** Script will show you exactly what failed and why, then prompt you to retry. Most failures are temporary network issues - just press 'y' to retry!

### OneNote Specific

**"No notebooks found"**
- Verify notebooks exist at https://www.onenote.com
- Check Azure app has Notes.Read permissions
- Try re-authenticating
